# 1. Compute the mean and median of a heating behaviour index (e.g., behaviour_heat).
- Comment on whether the distribution appears symmetric or skewed.

# 2. Calculate the standard deviation, interquartile range (IQR), and minimum/maximum values for the same heating behaviour index. 
- Briefly explain what this reveals about the variability of heating behaviour.

# 3. Plot a histogram of an electricity behaviour index (behaviour_elec).
- Describe the distribution in 3–4 sentences (skewness, shape, outliers, clustering).

# 4. Create a boxplot of the same electricity behaviour index.
- Explain how it adds information compared to the histogram.

# 5. Produce grouped descriptive statistics (mean, SD, n) for electricity behaviour across ownership types. 
- Identify the groups with the highest and lowest mean values.

# 6. Compute a cross-tabulation of gender by ownership type and convert it into column proportions. 
- Comment on whether group composition appears balanced or skewed.

# 7. Calculate a correlation between behaviour_elec and income (or income_range). 
- Interpret the sign, strength, and behavioural meaning of this relationship.

# 8. Run a t-test comparing electricity behaviour between two groups of your choice (e.g., men vs women, owners vs tenants).
- Interpret the mean difference, p-value, and confidence interval.

# 9. Run an ANOVA comparing electricity behaviour across three or more ownership categories. 
- Report the F-statistic and p-value and explain the implication of the overall result.

# 10. Run a Tukey post-hoc test after the ANOVA. 
- Identify two pairs of groups that differ most clearly and interpret the behavioural significance (1–2 sentences each).

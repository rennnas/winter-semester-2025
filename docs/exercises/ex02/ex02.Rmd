# 1. Load tidyverse and import the file you saved in Session 1: 
outputs/finsesco_s1.csv.
  
# 2. Filter a working sample:
  Keep rows with non-missing income_range, is_prosumer, and behaviour_elec_scaled.

# 3. Ensure tidy factor orders:

  income_range: Low → Middle → High
  is_prosumer: Non-prosumer (0) → Prosumer (1) 

# 3. Build a Motivation Index:
  Compute motivation_mean = row mean of v_40_1: v_40_6 (ignore NAs).

# 4. Standardize to motivation_z (z-score).

# 5. Descriptives by group:

  Mean, SD, n of behaviour_elec_scaled by income_range.
  Same by is_prosumer and by both (two-way summary).

# 6. Cross-tab:
  Counts of is_prosumer by income_range.


# 7. Visualization #1:
  Boxplot of behaviour_elec_scaled by is_prosumer.


# 8. Visualization #2:
  Stacked (proportion) bar chart of is_prosumer within each income_range.

# 9. Nice summary table:
  Create a table with income_range, mean_behaviour, sd_behaviour, n as number of observations using dplyr.

# 10. Save outputs:
  Write outputs/finsesco_clean.csv (with your new index columns).

# 11. Save the cross-tab as outputs/prosumer_by_income.csv.

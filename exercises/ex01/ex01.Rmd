# 1. Create a new R Project in your course folder. 
  Add subfolders: data/, outputs/, scripts/.

# 2. Install/load packages: 
  tidyverse, readr, janitor.

# 3. Import the dataset:
  Read data/finsesco.csv into an object called finsesco.

# 4. Get your bearings:
  Print dim(), names(), and glimpse().

# 5.Clean column names:
  Use janitor::clean_names() and reassign.

# 6. Select a working view:
  Keep an ID and these variables (or closest equivalents you find):
 age, gender, state, income_bracket, prosumer_status, behaviour_elec_scaled, v_40_1:v_40_6.

# 7. Create tidy helper variables:
  income_range collapsed into Low / Middle / High from income_bracket.
  is_prosumer as a logical or factor from prosumer_status.

# 8. Quick data quality check:
  Count total rows, distinct IDs, and make a small NA summary for the selected columns.

# 9. Make two quick plots:

  Histogram of behaviour_elec_scaled.
  Bar chart of income_range (ordered Low → Middle → High).

# 10. Save a slim, clean object:
  Write outputs/finsesco_s1.csv with only the selected/created columns.
